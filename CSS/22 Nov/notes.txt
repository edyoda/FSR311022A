Box Model ?
Every HTML element is a box for CSS.

Layers of Box Model : 

1. Content (Inner most Layer) : It has the content/childrens of an element.
2. Border : This defines the fencing/bounding area of an element (This is the fencing of my house).
3. Padding: This is the space between the border/fencing and the content
4. Margin : This is the space outside the box (This is the space between 2 neighbours.)



Total Widht of box : Width of content + Widht of padding + width of border
Same for calculating height as well.
