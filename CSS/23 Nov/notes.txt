Display Values : 
    block : 
    inline : We can not apply height/width or margin properties to an inline element i.e it will not take any effect.
    inline-block : Combination of block and inline elements i.e it allows us to change width/height margin etc and it keeps the element in the same line (behaves like inline element). 


Position?

Types of positions

position: <position-value>;

    static: Default position of all HTML elemments (Item will follow the same order on screen as they are written in code)
    relative: Helps in shifting the element RELATIVE TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION ON THE SCREEN
    absolute: When position is set to absolute the parent and neighbours(siblings) adjust the remaining space accordingly. 
    Helps in shifting the element in 2 ways
        1. If the parent is static then the distance is calculated in respect to the html tag (browser's window).
        2. If the parent is non static then distance is calculated in respsect to the parent.
    fixed : Remains at fixed position in respect to the browser
    sticky: It behaves like fixed when give any TBLR value.
