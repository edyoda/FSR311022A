JavaScript? A scripting/programming language.
Parts of web dev : 
1 Front End : HTML, CSS, JS
2 Back End : Java, Python, PHP, JS etc

Frameworks in JS :

JS is case sensitive language.

JavaScript 
1. Variable : It is used to store data in a programming language and the value can vary from time to time.
Syntax : 
var <name-of-variable>=<value-of-variable>;


How to decide what name should we give to a variable?

Rules of naming a variable
1. You can not give space in the name of a variable.
2. You can use alphabets, digits, _ and $ in the name of a variable & You can not start the name of a variable with a number.
3. You can't use keyword (reserved words) as the name of variable e.g (this, var, let, const, while, for , of etc)


// Suggest a variable name which will hold the value of the disocunt on earpohnes?

Patterns of naming variables : 
var earphones_discount = 10; // Snake case
var EarphonesDiscount = 10; // Pascal case
var earphonesDiscount = 10; // Camel case

// Sugges a variable name which will hold the value of age of the user?

var age = 20;

var user_age = 20; // Snake case
var UserAge = 20; // Pascal case
var userAge = 20; // Camel case


var scienceMarks = 80;

// hello this is a very long variable name

var helloThisIsAVeryLongVariableName;

Snake Case => SQL
Pascal Case => .net
Camel Case => JavaScript


Data Type => Type of data which can be stored into a variable.

2 Classes of Data Types : 

1. Primitive/Fundamental/Basic Data Types
    1.1 Numbers : 10,20,30, -20, -10, 0 , 12.41, 68.123 etc
    1.2 String : John Doe, Jane, Alex, ABCD, XYZ
    1.3 Boolean : true or false
    1.4 Null : When you don't have any value to assign to a variable then you assign null to it. (EMPTY)
    1.5 Undefined : When no value is given to a variable (NOT EVEN NULL)
2. Non Primitive/User Defined/Reference/Advanced Data Types
    2.1 Arrays : Collection of homogenous data types.
    2.2 Objects : Collection of key value pairs


NOTE : ANYTHING THAT WE WRITE WITHIN DOUBLE OR SINGLE QUOTES IS A STRING
